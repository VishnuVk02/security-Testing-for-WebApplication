*DOMAIN*: SOFTWARE TESTING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*DESCRIPTION* :
    This project aims to assess and improve the security of a web application by conducting comprehensive security testing with a specific focus on detecting common and critical vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The project involves planning, executing, and reporting on a series of tests designed to evaluate the application’s resilience against malicious attacks that could compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

In today’s rapidly evolving digital ecosystem, web applications are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals due to the large volume of data they process and store. Vulnerabilities like SQLi and XSS are consistently listed among the top threats in the OWASP Top 10, making them high-priority risks for any application handling user data. This project addresses these threats through a practical, hands-on approach using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

Objectives:
To understand and implement the principles of web application security testing.

To identify and demonstrate SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities in a given web application.

To utilize automated and manual security testing tools effectively.

To propose and validate mitigation techniques for discovered vulnerabilities.

To document all findings and provide actionable recommendations to enhance application security.

Scope:
The scope of this project is limited to black-box and gray-box testing techniques, focusing on the application layer of a selected web application (e.g., a custom-built or open-source e-commerce platform or content management system). The project will assess input fields, URLs, and parameters that interact with back-end systems, with the aim of identifying injection points and scripting flaws. Network-level testing and denial-of-service scenarios are excluded to avoid service disruptions.

Expected Outcomes:
By the end of this project, the application will have undergone a focused security assessment, and the most critical vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS will be either confirmed or ruled out. The application owner will receive clear, actionable insights into how to secure their system, and the tester will gain valuable hands-on experience with ethical hacking and web security testing tools.
